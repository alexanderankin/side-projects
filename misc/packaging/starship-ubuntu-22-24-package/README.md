starship is only available in ubuntu 25+,
which means people are waiting until mid 2026 to use it.

this package will work for ubuntu 22, 24.

it includes:

```text
/usr/bin/starship
/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/starship
/usr/share/doc/starship/README.Debian
/usr/share/doc/starship/README.md.gz

/usr/share/fish/vendor_completions.d/starship.fish
/usr/share/lintian/overrides/starship

```

* todo implement this

note: the ubuntu package contains stuff not in github releases,
so this is double annoying - have to figure out how to download the original.

probably with "apt download".
