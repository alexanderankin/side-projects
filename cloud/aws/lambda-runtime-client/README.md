# Lambda Runtime API Client

An "AWS Runtime Client" that doesn't suck.

The official one sucks a lot, I don't know who let these people maintain software.
You can watch them flail around here https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-nodejs-runtime-interface-client.
The hangup is they want to do http over libcurl:
https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-nodejs-runtime-interface-client/pull/8.

What a ridiculous hangup.

Before this project becomes real, it should get some users and its own repo.
